UD++ is a Chrome extension adding a suite of very needed features to [Uddata+](https://www.uddataplus.dk). The extension is under heavy development, and currently we have the following available features:

* Custom themes changing the look of the website
* Mark lessons for which you have homework
* Save a copy of your schedule for when Uddata+ is down
* Calculate your weighted grade average
* Automatically sort assignments on the assignments page
* Hide lessons by keywords (If you're not the sort of person whose interested in studying caf√©s)
* Notify the user when EASY-A is about to go down, taking down Udata with it

If you have any suggestions, or bugs to report, don't be afraid to get in touch. You can find our GitHub page rather easily from here I think.

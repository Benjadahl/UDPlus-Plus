# The bin folder
This folder will contain the production code for the application.

*THIS CODE SHOULD NEVER BE EDITED MANUALLY*

Instead use the Bash script to build the application. The Bash script will not include the testing pages. Any development purposes should therefore be done in the **/src/** folder.
